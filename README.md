# Welcome to asteroidml!

This is the repository for the coding we will be doing. 

Eventually, to avoid overriding each other, we will make branches and have parallel work tracks that get merged into the main working branch.

For now, take a look around and make sure your computer isn't angry with the fact that github exists. :)
